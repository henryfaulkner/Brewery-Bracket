# PRFT-Deficient

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Development Workflow

We use [Github's Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) to collaberate and share code.

## REST API Documentation

Our REST API is documented here: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/henryfaulkner/brewery-bracket/0.1.0#/

## Getting Started

Run npm install at both your top-level folder (wherever you installed the project) and the 404 folder.

Now you can run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the result (or whichever port it specifies).

## Developing

Your linter might be mad at you, initially. At the moment, we recommend going into your settings and disabling it.
File >> Preferences >> Settings
Search "eslint quiet", or just disable it entirely.
